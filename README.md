# Tetris-Clone
This is a tetris clone I made from scratch using the pygame library. 

Install the pygame library onto your computer before running.

To run, simply use the python command on the 'main.py' like so...
"python main.py"

Controls:
Left/Right Arrow Keys to move piece left/right.
Down Arrow Key to speed up the piece's drop.
Z/X to rotate piece left and right respectively.
C to hold the current piece.
